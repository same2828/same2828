# Redis

> Redis is a in-memory data structure store, used as a key-value database.

Because it is in-memory it can leverage efficient low level data-structures including but not limited to:

- Linked Lists
- Sets
- Hash Tables
- Streams
- JSON

## Trade-offs:

**Advantages**

- High read/write throughput because its in-memory
  - Memory access is significantly faster than random disk I/O (DB)
- Low latency
  **Disadvantages**
- Dataset cannot be larger than memory

## Uses

- Caching
- Messaging/Queues
- Real time leaderboards
- Session Storage
- Rate Limiters
