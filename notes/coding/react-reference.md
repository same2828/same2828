## DOM Props

- These special React props are supported for all built-in components
  - They are "reserved"/"proejcted" and CANNOT be used

```jsx
<div propName="hi"><div/>
```

| DOM Prop                         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `key`                            | A special prop used when rendering lists of components. It helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `children`                       | A React node (an element, a string, a number, a portal, an empty node like null, undefined and booleans, or an array of other React nodes). Specifies the content inside the component. When you use JSX, you will usually specify the children prop implicitly by nesting tags like `<div><span /></div>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`        | An object of the form `{ __html: '<p>some html</p>' }` with a raw HTML string inside. Overrides the innerHTML property of the DOM node and displays the passed HTML inside. This should be used with extreme caution! If the HTML inside isn't trusted (for example, if it's based on user data), you risk introducing an XSS vulnerability. Read more about using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `ref`                            | A ref object from useRef or createRef, or a ref callback function, or a string for legacy refs. Your ref will be filled with the DOM element for this node. Read more about manipulating the DOM with refs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `suppressContentEditableWarning` | A boolean. If true, suppresses the warning that React shows for elements that both have children and contentEditable={true} (which normally do not work together). Use this if you're building a text input library that manages the contentEditable content manually                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `suppressHydrationWarning`       | A boolean. If you use server rendering, normally there is a warning when the server and the client render different content. In some rare cases (like timestamps), it is very hard or impossible to guarantee an exact match. If you set suppressHydrationWarning to true, React will not warn you about mismatches in the attributes and the content of that element. It only works one level deep, and is intended to be used as an escape hatch. Don't overuse it. Read about suppressing hydration errors                                                                                                                 |
| `style`                          | An object with CSS styles, for example `{ fontWeight: 'bold', margin: 20 }`. Similarly to the DOM style property, the CSS property names need to be written as camelCase, for example fontWeight instead of font-weight. You can pass strings or numbers as values. If you pass a number, like width: 100, React will automatically append px ("pixels") to the value unless it's a unitless property. We recommend using style only for dynamic styles where you don't know the style values ahead of time. In other cases, applying plain CSS classes with className is more efficient.

## DOM Elements

- These standard DOM props are also supported for all built-in components

| DOM Element                   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `accessKey`                   | A string. Specifies a keyboard shortcut for the element. Not generally recommended                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `aria-*`                      | ARIA attributes let you specify the accessibility tree information for this element. See ARIA attributes for a complete reference. In React, all ARIA attribute names are exactly the same as in HTML                                                                                                             |
| `autoCapitalize`              | A string. Specifies whether and how the user input should be capitalized                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `className`                   | A string. Specifies the element's CSS class name. Read more about applying CSS styles                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `contentEditable`             | A boolean. If true, the browser lets the user edit the rendered element directly. This is used to implement rich text input libraries like Lexical. React warns if you try to pass React children to an element with contentEditable={true} because React will not be able to update its content after user edits |
| `data-*`                      | Data attributes let you attach some string data to the element, for example data-fruit="banana". In React, they are not commonly used because you would usually read data from props or state instead                                                                                                             |
| `dir`                         | Either 'ltr' or 'rtl'. Specifies the text direction of the element                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `draggable`                   | A boolean. Specifies whether the element is draggable. Part of HTML Drag and Drop API                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `enterKeyHint`                | A string. Specifies which action to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `htmlFor`                     | A string. For `<label>` and `<output>`, lets you associate the label with some control. Same as for HTML attribute. React uses the standard DOM property names (htmlFor) instead of HTML attribute names                                                                                                          |
| `hidden`                      | A boolean or a string. Specifies whether the element should be hidden                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `id`                          | A string. Specifies a unique identifier for this element, which can be used to find it later or connect it with other elements. Generate it with useId to avoid clashes between multiple instances of the same component                                                                                          |
| `is`                          | A string. If specified, the component will behave like a custom element                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `inputMode`                   | A string. Specifies what kind of keyboard to display (for example, text, number or telephone)                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `itemProp`                    | A string. Specifies which property the element represents for structured data crawlers                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `lang`                        | A string. Specifies the language of the element                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `onAnimationEnd`              | An AnimationEvent handler function. Fires when a CSS animation completes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

- You cannot pass both `children` and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` at the same time
- Some events (like `onAbort` and `onLoad`) do NOT bubble in the browser, but do bubble in React
